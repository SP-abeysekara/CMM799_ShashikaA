Written in 2008 as a deliberation on the creative process, the film relates a day in the life of a young girl and her mother as they brave two very separate realities governed by the desire to both reject, and conform to, the societal roles imposed upon them.  Shot on super 8 between 2009 and 2010 and scored during the spring and summer months of 2010, The Freemartin Calf is imbued with a delicate fragility synonymous with the inner experience of its protagonists.""",0.6,,,,,,,,,Jayne Amara Ross,"Fabienne Mésenge, Nick Alldridge, Orna Assouline"

In fact, Jesus said that the most important thing in life is to love God with everything we've got and love others the same way. But it's not always easy to love everyone around us, is it? Sometimes we strongly disagree with other people's political views, religious beliefs, behaviors, or something else, and it makes it hard to love them when we feel like we're right and they're very wrong. But Jesus doesn't separate loving God and loving others. So maybe the best way for us to show our love for God is actually by loving other people no matter how hard it sometimes is.

""This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through"" is more than a line from an old song. This sojourner's theme has been told to children in stories, sent in letters of encouragement to friends, preached from pulpits and whispered behind the closed doors of the underground church in times of persecution. But mostly, it's been sung. When kings were unjust, they sang of a kingdom whose builder and ruler was God. When the world seemd like a foreign country and when the strange language of power and materialism was the accepted tongue, these pilgrims reminded each other that they were natives of a far better place to which they were traveling. When they were separated, estranged or lonely, they sang of a great homecoming when all the singers would one day be together around their Father's throne.",0.6,/3bK3LoufxWmB0vuKxrczZmwDbyN.jpg,,Music,Gaither Television Productions,United States of America,English,"homecoming, gaither, southern gospel",,David Streit,"James Blackwood, Terry Blackwood, Ray Boltz"

This first ""battle"" of the cold war started with the Soviet blockade of Berlin, a move to force the Western Allied powers to abandon their post World War II control of West Berlin. The Soviet blockade included all rail, road and water communications. On June 26, 1948, the United States and Britain began a year-long effort, documented here, to supply West Berlin by air. By July, the Soviet army had increased into 40 divisions - against eight for the West. The blockade ended on May 12, 1949. This is the story of the blockade, told by those involved. They describe the enormous logistical effort to transport some 2.3 million tons of food, fuel and equipment -- a battle the Western powers won.

The scenes that were made in a pseudo-documentary manner of the rebellious 1970’s remind of medieval Pieta exalting self-sacrificingness, pain, suffering and religious ecstasy. Richard ‘Hell’ Meyers, one of the representatives of the rock culture of the 70’s, came up with a term of ‘blank generation’ (the term may evidently be interpreted as a ‘lost generation’) to describe himself and his friends and thus advanced a philosophy of people seeking self-destruction. They get involved in meaningless and deadly situations to find a justification for living their lives. The film represents a story about wounded young men, who find themselves on an island and meet there a girl sailing the seas in a military launch, as a metaphor for an attempt to save the ‘blank/lost’ generation.",0.6,/7TJRqmZ5K1zrPRLVdi93k0XnU4b.jpg,,,,,,,,,

For half a millennium, its perfect harbour has provided a safe refuge in the middle of the treacherous North Atlantic. For 300 years of its history it was an actual crime to try and settle--Newfoundland was the private preserve of British fishing merchants. But people stayed, despite the colonial masters, despite the lack of law and order, despite hellish weather and raging seas. And the city grew--lurching through centuries of crisis, disaster, privation. For filmmaker Rosemary House, ""This is still a hard rock land, a dirty old town at the back of beyond. And yet the St. John's townie is so proud, you'd swear we lived in Paris."" In this documentary, she explores her city with the help of six locals, Mary Walsh, Andy Jones, Anita Best, Brian Hennessey, Ed Riche, Des Walsh, writers and performers all.

The fill—once spliced into 16mm magnetic audio tracks of another film—had been stored in a wet basement. Water damage had caused the two to stick together. I was asked to replace the fill in order to transfer the audio to a digital medium for preservation purposes. I removed and spliced the bits of discarded picture together and projected it in an effort to gain some understanding of the original footage. Later I reprinted it, via the optical printer, fascinated by the bits of picture/past left unobscured by the residual blotches of mag, and in doing so I literally watched its continued demise; its further fall into chaos.

His person and music carry a secret that only unravels for those who can see behind the words, who forget themselves in the music and let the sounds Tõnu created take them along on a mystical, poetical journey that changes anyone who arrives at the end. The film “Moorland Elegies” is named after Tõnu’s nine-part choir cycle, based on Emily Brontë’s almost gothic, dark poetry, that invokes spiritual conditions delicately translated into natural imagery. Tõnu’s enchantingly powerful “Moorland Elegies” has been one of the most sold classical records on the Amazon charts and forms the musical and material core of the film.
